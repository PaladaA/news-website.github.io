HOLIER THAN THOU This is the secret message hidden in Selena Gomez’ Met Gala look
The singer was styled by Coach for the event but added her own personal touch.
But Selena Gomez 2018 Met Gala look carried a much more subtle message that any but the most eagle-eyed would have missed.

The 25-year-old singer, who was styled by Coach, wore a ruffled gown with silk gauze and hand-pleated frills, and carried a small cream handbag.

And the message was in the detail of the bag which, according to Coach, was "finished with a personal touch from Ms. Gomez."

A close up of the bag on the brand’s Instagram page revealed an embroidered message which read: “A woman who fears the lord is a woman who shall be praised.”
The quote is a Bible verse taken from Proverbs, and was chosen by the star herself.

There was another Bible quote on the ribbon of her dress, but it was unreadable on the Instagram pic.

It’s not the first time the star has used the Met red carpet to give out a positive message.

Last year her bag read: “Love yourself first."

RUDE GIRL Rihanna is about to launch her own lingerie line and fans are VERY excited
The singer is widening her already established fashion and beauty empire to include the Savage x Fenty underwear collection set to be released this year.
RIHANNA has already conquered the worlds of music, fashion and beauty – but now she is about to launch her first all-inclusive lingerie line.

The 30-year-old teased the Savage x Fenty underwear collection, which is yet to see a release date, in a series of sensual short videos picturing models in pink lacy lingerie on Instagram.

Rihanna’s own sex appeal is obvious in the confidence and swagger she carries with her personal style, which includes a fair share of see-through pieces, and this is set to carry through to her lingerie.

The teaser campaign features a blurred, shuttered video of the self-proclaimed ‘bad girl’ in a baby pink bra, suggesting at a colour scheme that is just as wearable as her choice in inclusive sizing.

On the Savage lingerie website, sizes are available from 32A to a 44DD cup, and the underwear ranges from XS to a size 3X, so most women should be able to find something that fits.

Despite being left in the unknown about the lingerie’s release, fans can sign up through the official Savage website for updates on the collection.
Already the Savage x Fenty Instagram account has over 120,000 eager followers, following the cryptic teaser on Riri’s main Instagram page captioned ‘didn’t they tell you’.

The caption is an allusion to the lyrics of her 2016 song ‘Needed Me’, where she refers to herself as a ‘savage’ – hence the name of her latest brand.

The news comes only weeks after the star decided to add skincare to the Fenty Beauty cosmetics line, and the shimmering Body Lava quickly sold out.

And fans are just as excited about the lingerie collection, with many taking to social media to share their opinions on the teaser campaign.
