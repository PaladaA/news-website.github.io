                <p class="text">It is finals weekend at the Australian Open and during Saturday's Ladies final, Simona Halep and Caroline Wozniacki took a break before the final set.

               World No 2 Wozniacki won the first set 7-6, but Halep came back in the second to level the sets.
               THE heat rule indicates that when humidity gets to 50%, the umpire can pause the game for a set time. 

               Players  get 10 minutes off court in the locker room to cool down.

               The rule was enforced following the conclusion off the second set and both players took 10 minutes before the start of the third.
               The rule has been enforced twice in this year's Australian Open. 

               Both occasions happened on the same day with the first time was during the men's wheelchair final.
               A maiden Grand Slam title that meant so much to both players could, sadly, only belong to one. Caroline Wozniacki is the 2018 Australian Open champion after an enthralling battle between two great baseline warriors ended 7-6 (7-2) 3-6 6-4 with raw emotion from both players, but at brave Simona Halep’s expense.

               In hot and humid conditions on Rod Laver Arena, a match that lasted two hours and 49 minutes was not just a test of tennis, and nerve, but of courage and will. The first major women’s final in the Open era between two women who had saved match points to get there was decided on the first with a netted Halep backhand.</p>

Maybe the biggest one, because all the things that were going on this tournament, first grand slam of the year, first final here. So I take it like a nice thing and with good thoughts. Nothing else.”</p>
