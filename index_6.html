                <p>McGregor, who is still weighing up his next fight after his cross-over bout with The Money in August, said Floyd should return the favour after he made the switch to Queensberry Rules last year.<br>
                The Notorious said: “If he does do it, I know he’s flirting with it, I would have respect for him. I think it would get his earned respect then, if he was to step in [the Octagon].<br>
                 <br>
                "He’s engaging, we’re engaging, so we’ll see.”<br>
                 <br>
                McGregor says if the recent videos Mayweather has posted showing him in the octagon are just hype, “it will follow him for the rest of his days that he did not do it".<br>
                He added: “Of course, I’m seeing all the stuff Floyd’s putting out, all the stuff in the media.<br>
                “If it is [just hype], it will follow him for the rest of his days that he did not do it."<br>
                McGregor said he stepped up and went into the sport of boxing now Mayweather has to step into MMA.</p>

                <p>CONOR MCGREGOR is in negotiations for his next fight and admits he'd love to take on Floyd Mayweather in a UFC bout.
                   The Irish champ hasn't set foot in the Octagon since he beat Eddie Alvarez to claim the Lightweight Championship in November 2016.
                   It saw him become the first fighter to hold two titles in different weight divisions after defeating Jose Aldo to be crowned Featherweight Champion.
                   McGregor, 29, did try his hand at boxing in a mega-money scrap against Mayweather last year but admits he is ready to return to his roots.</p>
